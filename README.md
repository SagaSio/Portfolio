## Folder Overview

### `/papers/`
A selection of academic reports and essays that I’m most proud of.  

Examples:
- **Cognitive Commerce in the Fashion Industry** — Explores how AI and cognitive commerce are transforming the U.S. fashion industry. Uses the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) framework to show how innovations like chatbots, virtual try-ons, and personalized recommendations are reshaping businesses, customer experience, and industry trends, while highlighting ethical and regulatory challenges.

- **Crumbl Cookies** — Analyzes how Crumbl became the fastest-growing U.S. cookie franchise by leveraging brand personality, STP marketing, and social media engagement rather than radical product innovation. Highlights how the company creates an experience-driven brand with rotating menus, visually appealing packaging, and digital interaction, while discussing challenges such as ethical sourcing, sustainability, and reliance on social media hype.

## About Me
I’m currently in my **fifth and final year** of studying to become a **Computer Science Engineer** with a **Master’s in Industrial Management** at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology** in Stockholm.

I’ve also spent a semester studying abroad in **Texas**, which taught me a lot about collaboration, independence, and adapting to new environments.
