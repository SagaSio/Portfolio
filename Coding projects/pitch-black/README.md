# Mini Game â€“ Godot Project

A small 2D game built in **Godot Engine** as part of my personal projects.

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic game development skills, including game logic, physics, UI, and user interaction.  
I also learned the basics of pixel art using Aseprite, creating my own sprites and animations.
Even though the game is simple, it showcases my ability to design, implement, and iterate on a complete software project.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Engine:** Godot  
- **Language:** GDScript  
- **Concepts practiced:** Object-oriented programming, collision detection, input handling, simple animations, and game loops.

## What I Learned
- Structuring a game project in Godot and managing scenes and scripts effectively.  
- Applying programming concepts in a visual, interactive context.  
- Debugging and iterating on small projects to improve user experience.  

## How to Play
Requires Godot Engine 4.x.
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Godot
3. Run the main scene to play the game.

## Next Steps / Improvements
- Add more levels or challenges.
- Improve graphics and animations.
- Implement scoring, achievements, collectibles.
- Explore exporting the game to desktop or web platforms.
